// Create a class that includes a data member that holds a “serial number” for each object created from the class. That is, the first
//  object created will be numbered 1, the second 2, and so on. To do this, you’ll need another data member that records a count of how
//  many objects have been created so far. (This member should apply to the class as a whole; not to individual objects. What keyword
//  specifies this?) Then, as each object is created, its constructor can examine this count member variable to determine the appropriate
//  serial number for the new object. Add a member function that permits an object to report its own serial number. Then write a main()
//  program that creates three objects and queries each one about its serial number. They should respond I am object number 2, and so on.
