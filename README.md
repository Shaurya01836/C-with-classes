## About

This repository is designed for beginners and intermediate-level C++ developers who want to learn and practice using classes to write structured and reusable code. Each example covers different aspects of C++ classes, such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, constructors, destructors, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shaurya01836/C-with-classes.git
   cd C-with-classes
   ```

2. **Compile the code** using a C++ compiler, for example:
   ```bash
   g++ filename.cpp -o output
   ./output
   ```

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of C++ syntax.
- Familiarity with object-oriented programming concepts is beneficial but not necessary.

## Features

- **Basic Class Structures**: Learn to define and use classes in C++.
- **Object-Oriented Programming Concepts**: Examples of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Advanced Topics**: Constructor and destructor overloading, operator overloading, and more.

## Code Structure

- Each example is contained in a separate `.cpp` file with relevant comments and explanations.
- The repository structure is organized to allow easy navigation of different concepts.

## Examples

1. **Basic Class Definition** - Learn the syntax for defining a simple class.
2. **Constructors and Destructors** - Understand how constructors and destructors work in class instances.
3. **Inheritance and Polymorphism** - Examples of how to extend classes and implement polymorphism.
